# **Project Title: Air Quality Prediction**
## **Problem statement:**
Built a model which can be perform on dataset to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) of India based on the independent features available with high accuracy.

## **Libraries used:**
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn
* zscore
* train_test_split
* StandardScaler
* r2_score
* mean_squared_error
* PolynomialFeatures

## **ML models used:**
* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* XGBoost Regressor

## **Evaluation metrics used:**
* r2 score
* adjusted r2 score
* root mean squared error (RMSE)

## **conclusion:**
Random forest Regressor is best fit for our data having the best R2 score of 0.84 and least Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.00546
